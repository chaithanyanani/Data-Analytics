## Decade-wise Crime Pattern and Trend Analysis Across Indian States (2015–2025)


## Description
This project focuses on analyzing crime trends across Indian states over a span of 10 years, divided into two phases:

-2015–2020(df1)

-2020–2025(df2)

I used Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib) to process and visualize crime data, helping to uncover patterns, trends, and critical insights about crime distribution, intensity, and change over time

## Key Analyses Performed:

1.Top 5 States with Highest Average Total Crimes (2015–2020 & 2020–2025):
Identified states with consistently high crime rates in both time periods by calculating the average total crimes.

2.Year-wise Total Crimes Comparison:
Analyzed how the total number of crimes fluctuated year by year to detect rising or falling trends across the country.

3.Crime Type Trend Over the Years (e.g., Theft):
Focused on specific crimes like theft to understand whether particular crime types are growing or declining.

4.Crime Proportion Per State:
Calculated each state's contribution to total crimes per year to highlight which states are more affected.

5.States with the Highest Crime Increase Over Time:
Detected states where crime numbers grew the most between the start and end years within each dataset.

6.States with Crime Decrease (df1 vs df2):
Identified states that saw a drop in total crime numbers from the first 5-year period to the second.

7.Crime Count Distribution:
Explored how crimes are distributed across states and crime types using histograms and distribution graphs.

8.Percentage of Each Crime Type:
Calculated what percentage each crime (like assault, theft, etc.) contributes to the overall crime total.

9.Top 5 Common Crimes in Both Periods:
Identified crimes that are common and consistently reported across both datasets.

10.State-wise % Change in Crime (2020–2025 vs. 2015–2020):
Calculated and visualized the percentage change in total crimes for each state to highlight areas of improvement or concern.

11.Total Crimes by State and Crime Type:
Visualized a breakdown of crimes per state and per crime type to understand regional patterns and focus areas.

#  Conclusion:

This project provided a comprehensive analysis of crime patterns across Indian states over two distinct periods: 2015–2020 and 2020–2025. By working with real-world datasets using Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib), I was able to explore crime trends, identify high-crime states, and measure changes in crime types over time.
